    <h1 class="interesting-background">Some Interesting Background Knowledge</h1>

    <p class="reinterpret-familiar"> This game, Conqueror, is a completely new invention, and I'd like to invite
        everyone to play it. Also, the game
        is the project for Critex and Clab. </p>
    <p class="reinterpret-familiar"> The inspiration for it came from a case presented during the Critex course, "What
        if you could hear color?" We
        all know that colors are meant to be seen. As Critex encourages us to view the world from different
        perspectives. I thought about using critical thinking to reinterpret and deconstruct something we take for
        granted. So, the game aims to create a new system using something familiar and accessible to everyone—poker
        cards. </p>
    <p class="reinterpret-familiar"> Unlike traditional poker games where the face cards (kings, queens, jacks) don’t
        differ significantly from the
        numbered cards, this game focuses on the characters of the face cards as its protagonists. And these
        protagonists’ game skills are based and inspired by researches of historical cultures, folk legends, and general
        cognitive associations. Of course, it's important to note that these character archetypes are not exclusive. The
        interpretation of who these characters represent varies across cultures and historical contexts. In my game, I
        considered the general consensus (who each card is commonly thought to represent) and the unique traits of each
        king in “poker world” (The King of Hearts is often depicted as the king with a soft heart. In some traditional
        versions, he is portrayed as the one who uses a sword to stab himself. The King of Diamonds symbolizes wealth,
        the King of Clubs represents military success, and the King of Spades embodies wisdom), I selected four
        historical kings to represent the main characters of my game. </p>

    <div class="info-container">
        <h2 class="game-characters-intro">Alexander the Great (King of Clubs)</h2>
        <img class="Alexander" src="okingImg/club.png" alt="Alexander">

        <h3 class="game-characters-intro"> Historical Background</h3>
        <p class="game-characters-intro"> Alexander III of Macedon, commonly known as Alexander the Great (356–323 BC),
            was one of history's most successful military commanders. Born in the ancient kingdom of Macedon (modern-day
            Greece), he ascended to the throne after the assassination of his father, King Philip II.Alexander is
            renowned for his unparalleled military conquests. By the age of 30,he had created one of the largest empires
            of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to Egypt and through the vast territories of the Persian
            Empire, reaching as far as India. His campaigns spread Greek culture, language,and ideas across these
            regions, giving rise to the Hellenistic Age, which saw a fusion of Eastern and Western cultures. He was
            tutored by the philosopher Aristotle, fostering his appreciation for knowledge, philosophy, and leadership.
            However, Alexander was also known for his relentless ambition and often ruthless pursuit of power.</p>
        <h4 class="game-characters-intro"> Cultural Interpretations </h4>
        <p class="game-characters-intro"> Alexander the Great's depiction as the King of Clubs highlights his role not
            only as a military conqueror but also as a ruler who reshaped the world through his influence. Unlike other
            Kings, the Clubs suit conveys energy, movement, and assertive ambition, making Alexander a fitting
            representation. While modern playing cards do not always explicitly link Kings to historical figures, such
            associations were more common in European card traditions during the Middle Ages and Renaissance.

        <h5 class="game-characters-intro">Charlemagne (King of Hearts)</h5>
        <img class="Charlemagne" src="okingImg/heart.png" alt="Charlemagne">
        <h6 class="game-characters-intro"> Historical Background</h6>
        <p class="game-characters-intro"> Charlemagne (c. 742–814), also known as Charles the Great, was the King of the
            Franks, the Lombards, and later the first Holy Roman Emperor. He is one of the most celebrated figures of
            European history for his efforts in unifying and expanding the territories of Western and Central
            Europe.During his reign, Charlemagne played a crucial role in the Carolingian Renaissance—a cultural and
            intellectual revival that preserved and spread classical knowledge, laid the foundation for European
            medieval civilization, and influenced church reform.His legacy as a unifier and champion of Christendom
            earned him reverence throughout the medieval period and beyond.
        </p>
        <h7 class="game-characters-intro"> Cultural Interpretations </h7>
        <p class="game-characters-intro"> Because of the heart suit’s association with emotion, the King of Hearts is
            often considered a symbol of love, compassion, and chivalry. These attributes align with the medieval
            chivalric ideals that were emphasized during Charlemagne’s era and later literary traditions. The King of
            Hearts is usually associated with positive leadership traits, including fairness, wisdom, and concern for
            the welfare of the realm. He represents a balanced approach to leadership, combining military prowess with a
            deep moral compass and cultural vision.

        <h8 class="game-characters-intro">King David (King of Spades)</h8>
        <img class="David" src="okingImg/spade.png" alt="David">
        <h9 class="game-characters-intro"> Historical Background</h9>
        <p class="game-characters-intro"> King David (c. 1040–970 BCE): David was the second king of Israel, succeeding
            Saul, and is most famous for uniting the twelve tribes of Israel into a single nation. His reign is seen as
            a golden age for Israel, marked by military conquests, territorial expansion, and cultural
            development.David’s most famous military accomplishment was his defeat of the giant Goliath, an event that
            became a symbol of triumph against overwhelming odds. David was also known for leading Israel in many
            successful campaigns, expanding its territory, and solidifying its political and military power.Apart from
            his military and political achievements, David is revered for his devotion to God. He is said to have
            composed many of the Psalms in the Bible and is known for his deep spirituality and his efforts to establish
            the worship of Yahweh as central to Israel’s identity.
        </p>
        <h10 class="game-characters-intro"> Cultural Interpretations </h10>
        <p class="game-characters-intro"> The King of Spades is a symbol of resilience in the face of challenges. In
            card games, this king can often represent a player who is poised and able to navigate complex situations,
            much like the historical King David’s ability to manage both personal and political crises. David’s life
            wasn’t just about conquest; it also involved great personal flaws and repentance. This duality is reflected
            in the King of Spades, who may represent a leader who has to balance strength with humility, power with
            introspection.
        </p>


        <h11 class="game-characters-intro"> Caesar Augustus (King of Diamonds)</h11>
        <img class="Caesar" src="okingImg/diamond.png" alt="Caesar">
        <h12 class="game-characters-intro"> Historical Background</h12>
        <p class="game-characters-intro">The King of Diamonds is commonly believed to represent the first Roman emperor,
            Augustus. Augustus successfully rebuilt the political system of the Roman Empire, increasing its wealth and
            power. As such, the King of Diamonds symbolizes authority, wealth, and political wisdom. The King of
            Diamonds is often linked to wealth, luxury, and the material world. The diamond suit symbolizes prosperity,
            riches, and the pursuit of material success. In this light, the King of Diamonds can represent a ruler who
            is not only wealthy but also focused on acquiring and managing resources, power, and material wealth.
        </p>
        <h13 class="game-characters-intro"> Cultural Interpretations </h13>
        <p class="game-characters-intro"> Unlike the King of Hearts, who is often seen as emotionally driven, the King
            of Diamonds is more pragmatic. His decision-making is often based on logic and rationality rather than
            emotion, and he is typically concerned with what will yield the greatest material benefit or financial
            success.
